# Cross Resource Cache for alt:V

Make a player, vehicle, or any other Entity saved to a MongoDB database with cross-resource accessible data.

This library is highly geared towards `TypeScript`.

## Why?

- If you've ever tried working with multiple resources in alt:V it can be painful.
- Trying to synchronize database read / writes creates a lot of duplicate code between resources.
- The aim of this library is to reduce that complexity by making it all viable through setters/getters.
- This is an experimental project to see if we can make alt:V cross resource viable.

# Installation
