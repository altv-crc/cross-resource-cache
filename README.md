# Cross Resource Cache for alt:V

An easy-to-use database library for alt:V that utilizes MongoDB.

Easily write data to your database by binding documents to alt:V Entities such as players, vehicles, and colshapes.

Data is cross-resource accessible meaning it can work in a multi-resource environment.

## Features

- If you've ever tried working with multiple resources in alt:V it can be painful.
- Trying to synchronize database read / writes creates a lot of duplicate code between resources.
- The aim of this library is to reduce that complexity by making it all viable through setters/getters.
- This is an experimental project to see if we can make alt:V cross resource viable.
